# React-examples
Some React (Native) code of mine from a school project.

These do not include the back end functionality, and they won't work on their own, thus they are somewhat incomplete in their current form.

## Alias minigame
The game was Alias (the word-explaining game), where one person gets the word to explain and the rest try to guess it; the next word has another explainer etc.

## Push The Buttons minigame (PTB)
The game was based on the Speed test game (where you press the buttons in the order they light up in constantly increasing speed), and was planned to be turned into a multiplayer by having one player to tell the sequence as it lighted up and having other player(s) press the buttons as the explainer told the sequence.
