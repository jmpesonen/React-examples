# React-examples
Some React (Native) code of mine from a school project.

These do not include the back end functionality, and they won't work on their own, thus they are somewhat incomplete in their current form.

# Alias minigame
The game was Alias (the word-explaining game), where one person gets the word to explain and the rest try to guess it; the next word has another explainer etc.
